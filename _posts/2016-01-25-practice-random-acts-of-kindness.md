1\. Practice Random Acts of Kindness.
We strive to create an emotional connection with our clients, employees, vendors and community. We do this by providing an unexpected level of personal service. 

2\. Embrace and Drive Change.
If you are not prepared to deal with constant change, then you're probably not a good fit for us. We must learn not only to not fear change, but to embrace it enthusiastically and, perhaps even more important, encourage and drive it. We must travel in the direction of our fears. 

3\. Create Fun and a Little Weirdness
We don't want to feel corporate and boring. We want to be able to laugh at ourselves. After all, we create pictures for a living. We look for both fun and humor in our daily work. That means we might be unconventional-- or else it wouldn't be a little weird. One side effect of encouraging weirdness is that it encourages people to think outside the box and be more innovative. We want to make sure everyone is also having fun at work. 

4\. Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded
Be bold and daring, but not reckless. We want everyone to not be afraid to take risks and make mistakes, because if people aren't making mistakes, they're not taking enough risks. We encourage people to make mistakes as long as they learn from them. We should always be seeking adventure and having fun exploring new possibilities. We approach situations with an open mind. 

5\. Pursue Growth and Learning
It's important for employees to grow both personally and professionally. It's important to constantly challenge and stretch yourself. We get better every day, but we'll never "get it right." We'll do our best to "get it right" and then do it again when we find out that things have changed. This is the cycle of growth, and it will never end. There are no "experts" at our company. The best expertise you can bring is expertise at learning, adapting and figuring new things out. 

6\. Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication
Openness and honesty make for the best relationship because that leads to trust and faith. We value strong relationships in all areas: managers, direct reports, customers, vendors, business partners, team members and co-workers.
A key ingredient in strong relationships is an emotional connection. In our relationships, we should be: compassionate, friendly, loyal and try to always "do the right thing". With trust, we can do anything. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what you say or do, but it's how you make people feel that matters most. 

7\. Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit
We want to create an environment that is friendly, warm and exciting. We don't lose sight of the fact that we make a living by making pictures and dreaming up stories. We encourage diversity in ideas, opinions and points of view. We can disagree without being disagreeable.We take ownership of issues and collaborate with others whenever challenges arise. We believe the best teams interact with each other in and outside the office. We are more than just a team, though-- we are a family.We watch out for each other, care for one another, and go above and beyond for each other. We work and play together. 

8\. Do More with Less
Though we are casual in our relationships, we are focused and serious about the operations of our business. We need to continuously innovate as well as make incremental improvements to our operations. We strive to consume/waste less. We use mistakes as learning opportunities. 

9\. Build Solutions Not Barriers
We value passion, determination, perseverance and problem solvers. We are resourceful and don't take "no" or "that'll never work" as an answer. We don't wait for others to solve our problems or compound a situation by adding more. We look for solutions even when no one is asking by volunteering and jumping in head first. 

10\. Be Humble
We've grown and achieved many things, but realize there are challenges ahead. No matter what happens, we must always be respectful of everyone. We celebrate our success, but not in an arrogant manner. We do not treat others differently than how we'd like to be treated.
